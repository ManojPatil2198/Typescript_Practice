// what is interface in typescript
// An interface in TypeScript is a syntactical contract that defines the shape of an object. 
// It specifies the properties and methods that an object must have, without providing the implementation details. 
// Interfaces are used to define the structure of data and to enforce type-checking in TypeScript.
// Object following Info interface
var studentObj = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 20,
    college: "ABC University"
};
// Object following TeacherType interface
var teacherObj = {
    name: "Jane Smith",
    age: 35,
    college: "ABC University",
    subject: "Mathematics"
};
// Another Info object
var managementObj = {
    name: "Smith",
    age: 45,
    college: "ABC University"
};
export {};
